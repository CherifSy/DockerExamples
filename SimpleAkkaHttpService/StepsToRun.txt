1. change to the directory
2. SBT
3. When in SBT console 
   > assembly
4. exit
5. docker-compose up from directory. I started to see errors like this
   
   WindowsError: [Error 3] The system cannot find the path specified: 'C:\\Users\\sacha\\Downloads\\akka-http-hello-world-m
   aster\\akka-http-hello-world-master\\target\\streams\\$global\\assemblyOption\\$global\\streams\\assembly\\0c81e49ff9131

   Did some googling this seems to be about the long file names that can occur on Windows. So I just copied the entire set of files/src/target etc etc to
   C:\X folder ignoring any long file names that it said were bad. I simply ignored them
   
6. docker-compose up --build (if container was already running using docker-ps, grab its Id, then docker rm --force <ID>
7. Use postman to look at http://localhost:8080
